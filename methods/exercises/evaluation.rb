x = 2 # => 2 variable assignment expression returns the value assigned to the variable
puts x = 2 # => passing the variable assignment to puts which will print out the value assigned and 
#then return 'nil'
p name = "Joe" # => "Joe" Unlike the print or puts method, apparently when passing a variable assignment to p, it not only outputs the assigned value but also returns the assigned value.
four = "four" # => "four" variable assignment
print something = "nothing" # => nil - Like puts, print outputs the value being assigned but returns nil.
